## Issue Summary

**Duration of Outage:**  
June 10, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:30 UTC

**Impact:**  
Our e-commerce platform hit a snag and took a little siesta for 2.5 hours. During this snooze, about 60% of our customers experienced slow page loads or couldn't complete transactions. This hiccup led to a 40% drop in sales and a flood of "What the heck?" messages from our users.

**Root Cause:**  
A rogue database connection pool setting went haywire, guzzling up resources faster than a teenager at an all-you-can-eat buffet, causing our database to choke and the app to slow down.

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** 🌩️ **Kaboom!** Our monitoring system (Datadog) starts screaming about increased latency.
- **14:05 UTC:** 🛌 On-call engineer awakened from peaceful slumber via pager alert.
- **14:10 UTC:** 🧠 Initial thought: "Maybe it's just a heavy traffic day. Let's throw more servers at it."
- **14:20 UTC:** 📈 Web servers scaled up, but no dice. Problem persists.
- **14:30 UTC:** ⏳ Database connection timeouts start popping up. Uh-oh.
- **14:40 UTC:** 🔍 Misleading clue: Suspected network gremlins. Network checked—clean as a whistle.
- **14:50 UTC:** 📞 Called in the database wizards for some heavy lifting.
- **15:10 UTC:** 🔬 Wizards discovered excessive connections hogging all the database juice.
- **15:20 UTC:** 🛠️ Tweaked connection pool settings and rebooted the database.
- **15:30 UTC:** 🌅 Signs of life! Application performance stabilizing.
- **16:30 UTC:** 🏁 All clear! Systems back to normal, and sales start flowing again.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The root of our woes was a misconfigured database connection pool. Set to allow 500 connections, our poor database could only handle 200 without breaking a sweat. When traffic spiked, the database got overwhelmed and threw a tantrum, slowing down the entire site.

**Resolution:**  
We adjusted the connection pool settings to a more manageable 150 connections, well within our database's comfort zone. After a quick restart to clear out the cobwebs, everything was back to smooth sailing.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. **Configuration Reviews:** Schedule regular check-ups on our system configs to prevent future temper tantrums.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Set up a watchdog to keep a close eye on database connections and resource usage.
3. **Load Testing:** Run regular "stress tests" to ensure our system can handle Black Friday-esque traffic without breaking a sweat.

**Specific Tasks:**
1. **Patch Database Server:** Update to the latest and greatest version for peak performance.
2. **Add Monitoring Alerts:** Implement specific checks in Datadog for database connection usage.
3. **Automate Audits:** Deploy scripts to automatically sniff out and report any configuration gremlins.
4. **Team Training:** Arm our engineers with the knowledge to manage and configure connection pools like pros.
5. **Document Incident:** Write up this saga in our internal wiki so everyone learns from our adventure.

With these measures in place, we're confident our e-commerce site will stay awake and alert, ready to handle anything our users throw at it.
